            <h2>About the Legend</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Popularly known as Baba Saheb. He was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly and is called the 'Father of the Indian Constitution'.</li>
                <li>He was a jurist and an economist. Born into a caste that was considered untouchable, he faced many injustices and discrimination in society. He was born in Mhow in the Central Provinces (modern-day Madhya Pradesh) to a Marathi family with roots in the Ambadawe town of Ratnagiri, Maharashtra.</li>
                <li>Ambedkar was against the caste-based discriminations in society and advocated for the Dalits to organise and demand their rights.</li>
                <li>He established the Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha to promote education and socio-economic improvements among the Dalits. He started magazines like Mooknayak, Equality Janta and Bahishkrit Bharat.</li>
                <li>In 1927, he launched active agitation against untouchability. He organised and agitated for the right of Dalits to enter temples and to draw water from public water resources. He condemned Hindu scriptures that he thought propagated caste discrimination.</li>
                <li>He also worked as Minister of Labour in the Viceroyâ€™s Executive Council. After independence, Ambedkar became the first Law Minister in 1947 under the Congress-led government. Later he resigned due to differences with Jawaharlal Nehru on the Hindu Code Bill.</li>
                <li>Ambedkar considered the Right to Constitutional Remedy as the soul of the Constitution.</li>
